# Randy
## Project for Hacka-demic

### :link: LIVE LINK : [randyconnect.herokuapp.com](https://randyconnect.herokuapp.com)

## Motivation
A room full of like minded people, where everyone is banging their heads on the laptop trying to finish the project before the deadline and then sharing pizzas and running to coffee machines discussing about your ideas is what makes a Hackathon great. It's all about the interaction with some great people. It's all about collaboration and learning.

With Randy, we have tried to recreate it. It's a place where all the participants can come and they will be randomly matched with some other participant for a video call. They have 10 minutes, they can discuss about their projects, their ideas or just simply chat. And if they like, they can probably share their contact info and collaborate on a project later.

## How it Works ?
- First of all, you need to be a user of the site. You can login through Google or Github. Once you have done that, you will see your profile :

- Now, you can create or join a room. There's a unique ID for every room which you need if you want to join a particular room.
If you are a __Hackathon Organizer__ , you can create a room and ask the participants to join it.

- The room will appear in the list of all the rooms you are a part of

- Once you have entered a room, you are all set up for the random video call. Adjust your camera and mic and hit the _CONNECT_ button whenever you are ready.

__Don't worry, the camera's working fine, we have just disabled the video :wink:__

- It will search through all the active users in the room and set up your call with someone

- Once these 10 minutes are up, you can go on for another random meet up 

### Happy Hacking :smiley:
